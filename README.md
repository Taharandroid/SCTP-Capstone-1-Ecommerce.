2nd Dashboard 

Customer Inside :Analyzing 1001 customers with an average age of 41, a slight male majority (50.55%), and strong presence in Colombia and Chile, we find the 36-45 age group dominates income. With 75.81% Regular Customers and 24.19% High Spenders, we recommend targeted marketing campaigns, enhancing local strategies for Colombia and Chile, and implementing loyalty programs. Tailored marketing should focus on the 36-45 age group, while loyalty programs can boost engagement and retention among regular and high-spending customers.

Product Highlight: Products show high average purchase prices for dining sets and curtains; focus marketing on design aesthetics for affluent buyers. Top-selling units like sport shoes and wireless speakers should see more promotions. Maximize revenue from high-value categories such as curtains and wall art through bundling and cross-selling. Emphasizing design quality, promoting popular items, and leveraging bundling strategies will drive growth and boost revenue.
